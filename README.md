DLP-Projector-fan-and-bulb-override-msp430
==========================================

Basically a voltage to frequency converter for low KHz tachometer signals.
It was written to control an Acer 1220H DLP Projector that had 3 bad fan speed encoders and no light bulb.

P1.0 is the onboard Red LED, it blinks during the light bulb 'warm up' period, it's blinking roughly precedes a Red LED on the projector itself.

P1.1 connects to the positive lead of an optoisolator. This opto was originally turned on by the high-voltage lamp power supply board, the would cause the brown wire in the cable to the main DLP board to be pulled low to ground.

P1.2 connects to the (A) fan speed sensor input on the DLP control board. This is a 2 pulse per revolution PC fan.

P1.3 connects to the (B) fan speed sensor input on the DLP control board. This is a 2 pulse per revolution PC fan.

P1.4 connects to the (C) fan speed sensor input on the DLP control board. This is a 2 pulse per revolution PC fan.

P1.5 connects to the (A) fan Vcc output on the DLP control board via a voltage divider since the MSP430 is a 3.3V device

P1.2 connects to the (B) fan Vcc output on the DLP control board via a voltage divider since the MSP430 is a 3.3V device

P1.2 connects to the (C) fan Vcc output on the DLP control board via a voltage divider since the MSP430 is a 3.3V device


The min and max voltage I read on the fan Vcc lines was 5V and 10V. I happened to have 1KOhm resistors, and 3 of them take 10V to 3.3V so it was easy.

I haven't found the perfect value for the lampOffTime, it seems to jump around a bit on me, that said, when it works, it keeps the projector on for hours.


P.S. I wrote this using Energia as the compiler/IDE, etc... it has the same look and feel as Arduino... == EASIER!:
